        <h4>More about this project</h4>
        <p>Adaptive evolution is evolution in response to a selective pressure that increases fitness.
          In the context of viruses, the rate at which a protein evolves adaptively speaks to its evolutionary potential to undergo antigenic drift (evade antibody recognition), cross-species barriers, or escape drugs.
          In particular, a high rate of adaptation in a virus that has been endemic in humans for decades indicates that this virus is undergoing continuous adaptation, likely stemming from a changing selective landscape caused by an evolutionary arms race between the virus and its host.
          Because viral surface proteins are the primary targets of neutralizing antibodies, high rates of adaptation in viral surface protein typically indicates antigenic drift.<p>

        <p>Comparing rates of adaptation in the surface proteins of different viruses allows us to hypothesize which viruses evolve antigenically and which do not.
          From this comparison, we can also glean insight into the prevalence or rarity of antigenic evolution amongst RNA viruses that infect humans.
          Additionally, we can compare lesser-studied viruses to ones that are better-understood to extrapolate real-world implications of varying rates of adaptation.<p>

        <p>Each of these viruses contains a polymerase, which we expect to be relatively conserved, as well as surface protein (or protein subunit) that binds to a host-cell receptor.
          This plot compares the rates of adaptation within these genes.<p>

        <h4>Which viruses are included?</h4>
        <p>This panel focuses on viruses with an RNA genome (positive- or negative-sense) that are endemic in humans, and for which there are a minimum of 50 high-quality sequences spanning at least 20 years of time.<p>

        <h4>How are the rates calculated?</h4>

        <h4>What do these rates indicate about duration of immunity from natural infection or vaccination?</h4>
